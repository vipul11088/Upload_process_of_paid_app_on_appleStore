Upload_process_of_paid_app_on_appleStore
========================================
This tutorial teaches you the process of testing an iOS app on a device, and submitting it to the App Store. You can use the same HelloWorld app you created in Start Developing iOS Apps Today or you can follow the steps using your own app. This tutorial is about the process, not about how you design your user interface or write your code.
